Readability:

  Very good, very clean. Simple, efficient, and not elegant. The only criticism I can find is that the methods aren't capitalized.
  All of John's work was background tiles and they're all around 30 lines long so that's why these critiques are so bare-bone.

Maintanability:

  Given that nothing should change going forward, this file should have very good maintanability.

Conclusion:

  Background tile implimentations are a very easy task. They are both easy and quick to complete. However, this fact often leads to sloppy implimentations that,
  while workable, are not of good quality. It is very evident that John took his time to make sure this job was done right.
