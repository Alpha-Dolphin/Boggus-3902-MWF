Readability:

Easy to read. Most constant are defined in the link's constant class. So the link class is simple and readable. 

The only bit of drawback is that Aubet didn't comment his codes. Maybe he think his code are easy to understand, so it is reasonable.

Code Quality:

Link class is the player class, a lot of elements and functions are inside od this class. It was a hard work to do.
However, Aubert not only finish everything in a great quality, but also have them in a simple and changable form.


Conclusion:

This class is doing a great work. I use his design pattern in my own class too. His work on link class is a classical desgin I can learn from.
