NOT UPDATED
Readability:

	Very good readability, commenting, especially at the beginning of the file in the higher up functions, lends itself well to the highly complicated level loading process.
	However, commenting falls off a cliff in the lower functions, meaning the individual lines and blocks of code are esoteric and not very easily followed.
	Variable naming allows the reader to generally follow along with what sections of code are doing though.


Code Quality:

	It is difficult to gage the quality of the code since I have not worked with xml builders before.
	However, it seems like this functionality came belated, so I would wager a guess that development was troubled.
	Furthermore, there were a number of bugs that still needed to be ironed out when this code was finally added to main, meaning it is likely very difficult for even John to read it, but I don't know how much can really be done about that fact, seeing as writing an entirely new library is a ridiculous proposition.

Conclusion:

	This code is essentially as good as xml building allows it to be.
	While it is difficult to follow and very long, there is not really much that can be done to change this fact.
	This code is very solid in what it does.
