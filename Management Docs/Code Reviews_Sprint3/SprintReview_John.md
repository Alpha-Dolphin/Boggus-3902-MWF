Overall:
	Got an early start on critical pieces of code but did have to rush in the end to finish level design.
	Work was spread over the whole sprint but did not have a complete level parser by the intended deadline.
	Tried to adjust my code contributions to cover some of the more complex portions to allow others a break.
