Time Taken For Review: 15 Minutes

Readability:

	As readable as it can be. Just a list of rectangles to be drawn.


Code Quality:

	Good, does what it's supposed to so far. Simply draws rectangles in the necessary pattern to show the game over screen.

Conclusion:

	No complaints here. By next sprint it should all be integrated with the game states so we will be able to test it properly.
