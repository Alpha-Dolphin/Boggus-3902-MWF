Readability:

Easy to read and understand.
Code Quality:

It's just an interface, so good ig.
Conclusion:

How does John always manage to do work that is super hard to critique? Breaking up the interfaces into multiple files what how the project was intially handled.
Then, it was consolidated into one file, and now it was split back up into multiple. I personally think it doesn't matter too much, so long as everyone sticks to
one style of organization. John broke up all the interfaces well.
